# Dark and Darker Internal
(C++) Public release of dark and darker internal modification DLL using CG dumped sdks. 

This will not compile straight out of the box, it requires you to fix the overlay / replace it and add your own UI / Menu, both of which are SUPER easy to do. Everything here is undetected, it uses a SetWindowsHookEx injector that I did not make. The SDK is dumped using CG, this internal is simply a POC, and shouldn't really be used in practicality without changing anything. This codebase requires some coding knowledge to get going, so don't expect to press build and expect it to work.
